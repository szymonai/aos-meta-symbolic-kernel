# Formal Claims Boundary

This document defines the public scope of the Lean proof surface. It is a
boundary statement, not a full-system verification claim.

## Public Scope

The public Lean layer verifies selected properties of an abstract
`PASS` / `WARN` / `BLOCK` verdict model. The public Python runtime is tested
against the same decision behavior on a bounded demonstrator subset.
It also contains a small abstract contract for audit-ready decisions,
controlled-study protocol gating, and the stronger effectiveness-evidence gate.

This supports a limited statement:

> The public repository demonstrates selected formal properties of a bounded
> verdict model and tests the reference runtime against that model in the public
> demonstrator.

## What Is Covered

- abstract verdict behavior;
- deterministic `PASS` / `WARN` / `BLOCK` structure;
- selected interval-boundary properties;
- audit-ready decision predicates over abstract records;
- controlled-study readiness predicates over abstract study criteria;
- public evidence-level separation between protocol and effectiveness evidence;
- synthetic benchmark behavior;
- bounded runtime correspondence tests.

## Sufficiency Boundary

| Claim | Current Lean surface |
| --- | --- |
| Abstract verdict-integrity claim | Sufficient for selected invariants |
| Runtime equivalence claim | Not sufficient |
| Signal-extraction correctness claim | Not sufficient |
| Real-world effectiveness claim | Not sufficient |
| Production or regulated-use claim | Not sufficient |

The Lean target is a formal control-model artifact. It is valuable because it
removes ambiguity from the published verdict contract. It should not be used as
the main evidence that AOS improves model behavior.

## Build Quality Gate

The public verification path is:

```bash
lake build AOSPublicCore
python tools/verify_public_integrity.py
```

The integrity checker rejects Lean gap terms in committed Lean sources. A clean
Lean build plus that check supports the formal-boundary claim only.

## What Is Not Covered

- full Python-to-Lean refinement;
- arbitrary floating-point behavior;
- JSON/IO/security/key-management correctness;
- correctness of model-output hashes beyond the public runner checks;
- policy calibration or threshold validity;
- semantic truth of model outputs or retrieved evidence;
- deployment, concurrency, availability, or production security;
- domain, regulatory, financial, or safety approval;
- end-to-end product correctness.

## Safe Public Wording

Use:

> Lean verifies selected properties of the abstract public verdict model.

Avoid:

> The AOS system is formally verified.

Use:

> The public tests check bounded correspondence between the reference runtime
> and the public verdict model.

Avoid:

> The Lean layer proves production runtime correctness.

## Interpretation

A successful Lean build means that the selected formal target compiles in the
declared environment. It does not, by itself, prove the correctness of the full
system, the quality of domain policies, or the safety of any deployment.
